Formations.js


Running locally
---------------

The app needs to be served from a local server because it links to online versions of jquery and bootstrap. If you have python, run the following commands and it should run:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/dsyang/formationsjs
....
$> cd formationsjs
$> python -mSimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

```

Now open `localhost:8000/index.html` in chrome and you should see the app. Note: the index.html is required if you want to save/load.
